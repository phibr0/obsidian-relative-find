> This Plugin was created by request of @arvn over on Discord

This Plugin provides a new Command "Find relative to Cursor Position", to find occurences of words after or before your Cursor (or in the whole Document if you wish). Another (a bit unrelated) Feature was requested by @boninall, which lets you copy Search Results from Obsidian's Search Pane into your Clipboard via Command/Hotkey.

## How to install

1. Go to **Community Plugins** in your [Obsidian](https://www.obsidian.md) Settings and **disable** Safe Mode
2. Click on **Browse** and search for „Relative Find“
3. Click install
4. Toggle the Plugin on in the **Community Plugins** Tab
